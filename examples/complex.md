# Probability Density Functions (continuous vars)
- We can't list all the values on a table because continuous. So, we list ranges.
	- *N.B. square brackets are inclusive*
- So we can ask *"what is the probability of ''x'' falling in ''[a, b]''?"*

Question: *What is the probability that ''x'' lies in ''[a, b]''?*  
- To answer this question we need a pdf (probability distribution function), let's call ours ''f(x)''
- ''P(a <= x <= b) = int_a^b f(x) dx''
	- Total area under pdf is always 1

### Example 29.1
''x'' is a cont r.v. where ''x in [1, 4]'' the pdf is ''f(x) = 1/(2sqrt(x)) text( where ) 1 <= x <= 4''

a. Is ''f(x)'' a pdf?  
- Total must be 1
	- ''int_1^4 (1/(2sqrt(x))) dx = 1/2 int_1^4 (x^(-1/2)) dx = [(2 x^(1/2))/2]_1^4 = 
[sqrt(x)]_1^4 = sqrt(4) - sqrt(1) = 1''
		- So, yes

We can also do todo lists:  
- [ ] This isn't done yet
	- [ ] This isn't either
- [x] But this is

#  Majoritarian vs. Consensus government

- A majoritarian govt. can be formed by a majority or a plurality of the vote

| Source: Lijphart, 1984, 1999 | Majoritarian (Westminster) | Consensus |
|--|--|
| Executive Power | Concentrated | Dispersed |
| Relationship between exec and legislative | Fused. Exec dominates | Separated |
| Number of chambers | One | Two |
| Number of parties in legislatures | Two | Multiple |
| Electoral System | FPTP | Proportional |
| Relationship between central and local | Central dominates | Central doesn't dominate |
| Constitution | Nothing limiting anything | Supreme law constitution with judicial review |

===SINR(P) = log(1 + (PG_1)/(PG_2 + 1))=== (Signal Range with interference and noise ratio)

*Example*  
===G_1 = 1===, ===G_2 = 1/10===  
===SINR(P) = P/(P/10+1) = (10P)/(P+10)===

=-=
initPicture(0, 10, 0, 5)
axes()
stroke = "blue"
plot("(10x)/(x+10)")
=-=

We also support some TeX: ;;\mu Pad \text{ is cool! } a^2 + b^2 = c^2;;

I'm gonna put a page break after this.+-+-
